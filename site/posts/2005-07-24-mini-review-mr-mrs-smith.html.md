We went out to watch [Mr. & Mrs. Smith][1] last night. Despite the mediocre reviews the flick is receiving, I have to say, it was a two-hour fun ride for me. Pitt and Jolie seemed to have fun in their roles, and it showed. It was a thoroughly enjoyable romantic assassination comedy.

Recommended if you're looking for silly, funny, romantic and not-overly-deep summer movie.
