After many hours in the lab, spent on creating timelines and elaborate flow charts, I am proud to present you, World, my “Evolution of Digg.com”. I’ve manage to condense it into a few short lines, too:

Late 2004, Digg.com created ➔ “a fun site!” ➔ gains momentum, becomes useful
➔ single spammers appear, some fools, too ➔ OMG it’s spammed, lots of fools ➔
unbearable ➔ totally useless ➔ PRESENT DAY.

Don’t go there unless you feel like clawing your eyes out after being confronted with utter stupidity. If you actually _do_ feel like, pick any thread.

That is all.
