Cool NYT article is cool: ["Space Tourism: One Giant Leap for Researchers"][1].

There's a lot of research that can be done in the few minutes of zero G the upcoming commercial space flights will provide, but the rides are much, much cheaper than the NASA/ESA ones going to the ISS.

I still find it amazing to realize we live in a time where space tourism is a very real prospect, and not far-flung science fiction.
