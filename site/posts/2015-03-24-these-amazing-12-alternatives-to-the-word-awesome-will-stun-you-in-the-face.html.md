Awesome.  Everything's awesome.  Everybody's awesome.  So much awesome.  All the time, 24/7, maybe more!  And I get it: this is the 21st century.  All the things are totally amazeballs, without exception.  We're all winners, all of us.  Top of the game, thanks for playing, y'all.  

Anyways, I see your plight.  It's 20 minutes until that big meeting.  You're about to present your (baking soda volcano / disruptive startup / marriage proposal / weird old trick) to (a pack of super-critical VC's / traffic cop / an angry axe murderer / the Gods / HackerNews), and your pitch contains 200 instances of the word "awesome" while being 300 words long.  That's clearly less than ideal.  Your future (well-being / monies / job / sex life / accommodation) depends on these five minutes.

Fret not.  I'm here to help.  Take your pick from these fine alternative to the blatantly overused word "awesome".

1. _"good"_
1. _"nice"_
1. _"slightly amusing"_
1. _"meh"_
1. _"alright"_
1. _"quite okay"_
1. _"jolly"_
1. _"fucksticks"_
1. _"not butter"_
1. _"utter bollocks"_
1. _"yo papa"[*](http://amultiverse.com/comic/2015/03/20/yo-papa/)_
1. _"… err, does anyone here know how to use a dictionary? No? Well then. As I was saying…"_

At that point, "awesome" isn't a word anymore, it's a fucking comma.  Making an originally exceptional term meaningless just because we don't know any words — that's not cool, you guys.

Please, let us all stop.  Thank you for your time.
