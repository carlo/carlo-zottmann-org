For months, [Hendrik][1] and I were playing WoW with a guy weâ€™d never met before, Christian. Nice fellow, fun to chat with, one helluva [warlock][2].

Today he was making a stop in Munich (travelling by train), and we met for a quick snack, since he and his girlfriend only had half an hour or so until their train departed.

Turns out _sometimes_ the nice people you meet in a game are nice people in real life also. Cool beans!
