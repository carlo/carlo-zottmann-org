My original [Withings Activité Pop](http://www.withings.com/eu/en/products/activite-pop) silicone armband broke, and while I did want to class it up a mite with a replacement band, I really didn't want to spend $100+ on an original Withings leather armband.

So I went shopping around and in the end settled on a really nice, very affordable Hirsch [^1] "Forest" leather band.  I paid ~€27 for the medium-sized variant in light/golden brown.  I spend about half and hour in the store, checking out different armbands, and while I don't like all of them (different looks, different tastes) they're all really nice quality!

It doesn't have the quick release spring bars, tho — which works for me because I don't plan on going swimming anytime soon, and there have been no issues during/after my usual Fitstar training sessions.

I think the end result is quite nice, what do you think?
