Watched X-Men 2 last night. Hoo boy, what a movie. All in all I can say that I've enjoyed this one more than X-Men 1â€¦ it's longer, there are more butts being kicked, Wolverine is opening some cans of whoop-ass (although - for my taste - still not enough), and the story processes nicely. Nightcrawler is da bomb.

That's all I can say w/o spoiling anyone. :P
