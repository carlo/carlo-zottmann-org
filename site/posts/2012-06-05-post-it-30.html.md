<summary><strong>Bash one-liners, Flickr vs Yahoo!, low-innovation internet, draft posts in jekyll, a great zombie-related short.</strong></summary>

**This is useful.**  ["Bash One-Liners Explained"][bash-oneliners] is laying out in some detail the hows, whats and whys of bash's power in a number of examples.  Part I deals with files, and I've learned a few new tricks!  Bookmarked.

**This is depressing.**  I started at Yahoo just a few months after Yahoo! had snatched up Flickr, and I remember being happy about them doing it, for they were "the good guys".  I remember the [delicious acquisition][blog-yahoo-delicious] shortly afterwards, too.  I also remember what happened then, or better, what didn't happen, and how we were all a bit confused by the stalling.  So Gizmodo's ["How Yahoo Killed Flickr and Lost the Internet"][yahoo-flickr] was enlightening.

**This is sad.**  ["When Will this Low-Innovation Internet Era End?"][low-innovation], asks HBR's Justin Fox.  I think that's a damn good question.  Related: Doug Humphrey's [_"we will still need an Internet, once we are done putting the Entertainet in place"_][doug-humphrey].  (Via [Tim O'Reilly on G+][gplus-oreilly].)

**This is practical.**  I was complaining about [Jekyll][jekyll] not allowing for real draft posts, but then I found [a simple way around that particular problem][gist-jekyll-drafts].  Works for me, but as always, YMMV.

**Not your average zombie short.**	This is good: ["Spoiler"][vimeo-spoiler] is a gripping, really well made short movie about "normal life" after mankind dodged the zombie outbreak bullet.  No splatter, just intense and emotional story telling.
